title:  Julia 0.3 Release Announcement
author: The Julia Community
---

We are pleased to announce the release of Julia 0.3.0.  This release contains numerous improvements across the
board from standard library changes to pure performance enhancements as well as an expanded ecosystem of packages as
compared to the 0.2 releases. A summary of changes is available in [NEWS.md](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/release-0.3/NEWS.md)
found in our main repository, and binaries are now available on our [main download page](http://julialang.org/downloads/)

A few notable changes:

- cached system image for fast startup
- pure-Julia REPL, replacing readline and providing more functionality
- `workspace()` function to clear environment without restarting
- tab substitution of Latex characters (supported in the REPL, IJulia, and more)
- expanded Latex operators; Unicode normalization and many other Unicode improvements
- shared memory support (note: no multi-threading yet, but significant progress has been made this summer)
- improved hashing and floating point range support
- better tuple performance

We are now transitioning into the 0.4 development cycle and encourage users to use the 0.3.X line if they need a stable
julia environment.  Many breaking changes will be entering the environment over the course of the next few months. To reflect this period of change, nightly builds will use the versioning scheme 0.4.0-dev.  Once the major breaking changes have been merged and the
development cycle progresses towards a stable release, the version will shift to 0.4.0-pre, at which point package authors
and users should start to think about transitioning the codebases over to the 0.4.X line.

The release-0.3 branch of the codebase will remain open for bugfixes during this time. We encourage users facing
problems to open issues on our GitHub tracker, or email the julia-users mailing list.

Happy coding.
