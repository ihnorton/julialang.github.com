The release of Julia 0.2 on November 16, 2013 marked the end of an extended stabilisation period during which the trunk
was closed to riskier changes. Since the 0.2 release, activity on the core of Julia has seen significant developments.

Meanwhile, the Julia package ecosystem continues to grow by leaps and bounds, with a fast-growing group of new
contributors and exciting package announcements on a weekly basis.

Publications
------------

* [Dahua Lin's](http://dahua.me/) paper ["Online Learning of Nonparametric Mixture Models via Sequential Variational
Approximation"](http://dahua.me/papers/dhlin_nips13_sva.pdf) was presented at NIPS 2013. "All algorithms are implemented
using Julia [2], a new language for high performance technical computing."

Package Activity
----------------

* [Leah Hanson](http://blog.leahhanson.us/) has launched [juliawebstack.org](http://juliawebstack.org/) as an umbrella organization for the Julia Web Stack family of packages.

* [Ben Hamner](https://twitter.com/benhamner) has started a new [Machine Learning](https://github.com/benhamner/MachineLearning.jl) package with the
goal of ["creating a scikits-learn for Julia, with machine learning algorithms exposed through a consistent API."]
(https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl/pull/529)

* Jake Bolewski created [OpenCL bindings](https://github.com/jakebolewski/OpenCL.jl), and made a nice notebook demonstrating
[fractal generation in OpenCL](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jakebolewski/7517923), driven by Julia. Additionally,
the [CLFFT](https://github.com/jakebolewski/CLFFT.jl) package provides bindings to AMD's clFFT library using OpenCL.jl.

* [Jason Merrill](https://github.com/jwmerrill) created a new package for [Power Series](https://github.com/jwmerrill/PowerSeries.jl).

* LaurenceA created [Church.jl](https://github.com/LaurenceA/Church.jl), a new package aiming "to make it easy for anyone
to perform MCMC inference in complex, and simple, probabilistic models".

* [Avik Sengupta](http://www.sengupta.net/musings/) created [JavaCall](http://aviks.github.io/JavaCall.jl/) to
call Java from Julia,  and used this to build [Taro.jl](https://github.com/aviks/Taro.jl), a "utility belt of functions
to work with document files in Julia. It uses Apache Tika and Apache POI (via JavaCall) to process the files."

* [Spencer Russell](http://ssfrr.com/about-2/) created the PortAudio-based [AudioIO](https://github.com/ssfrr/AudioIO.jl), "a Julia library for interfacing to audio
streams, which include playing to and recording from sound cards, reading and writing audio files, [and] sending to 
network audio streams."

* The [Gtk](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Gtk.jl) bindings have received significant updates by Jameson Nash, and major new contributions from [Tim Holy](http://holylab.wustl.edu/) and
[Tobias Knopp](http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/~knopp/) (including [support for GtkBuilder](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Gtk.jl/pull/39))

* [Helge Eichhorn](http://helgeeichhorn.de/) created the [JPLEphemeris](https://github.com/helgee/JPLEphemeris.jl) package
to provide "efficient access and routines for the computation of the planet's state vectors directly from Julia" based
on "JPL Development Ephemerides [...] simulations of the Solar System used for spacecraft navigation
and astronomical purposes."

Base Activity
-------------

* [Arch Robison](http://software.intel.com/en-us/user/334537) has [proposed support](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/5355))
for SIMD instructions by implementing type-based alias analysis for Julia and enabling LLVM auto-vectorization.

* [Static compilation](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/4898) is now available for the base system image, reducing
startup times to well under 1 second.

* [Tuple performance](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/4042) has been improved by register or stack allocation
whenever possible, instead of allocating on the heap.

* LLVM's [MCJIT is now used]() by default on the trunk. MCJIT provides several advantages over the "legacy JIT", most
importantly continuity as the previous JIT is scheduled to be removed in LLVM 3.5. MCJIT opens the possibility of
[porting to ARM](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/3134) and  provides a path toward full debugger support.

* Local [Shared Memory array](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/5380) support for Linux/OS X was merged into
trunk.

* Julia can now be [compiled using Microsoft Visual C++](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/5347)
